##About
This is a mod for the [Heroes of Newerth](http://www.heroesofnewerth.com/) (HoN) video game to show an on-screen overlay displaying the total gold required for buy-back. (That is, the sum of the gold lost-on-death and the cost for the buy-back itself.)

##Install
0. You will need the [HoN Mod Manager](http://forums.heroesofnewerth.com/showthread.php?25883-HoN-Modification-Manager-1-3-6) to use this mod. So first, install that.

1. Once that is installed, you can download the latest release of the Buy-Back Gold mod from [here](https://github.com/mrhappyasthma/HoN-Buy-Back-Gold-Mod/releases/download/Latest/bbgold.honmod).

2. Place the downloaded `bbgold.honmod` file into your Heroes of Newerth directory under `game/mod` folders. For example: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Heroes of Newerth\game\mods`.

3. Open up `HoN Mod Manager` and enable `Buy Back Gold` mod: <br/><br/>

4. Click `File -> Apply Mods`: <br/><br/>

*Note: You will need to re-apply mods every time HoN is updated.* <br/><br/>
*This is done manually by opening HoN Mod Manager. It will detect the version change and give you a pop-up asking if you'd like to re-apply. Click yes, and you're good to go! If not, you're client WILL be very buggy.*

##Updating
Updating is also done through the HoN Mod Manager. Simply click on `File -> Download Mod Updates`: <br/><br/>

##Configuring the Overlay
###Default Options
You can change some default options by going the HoN `options` menu (the gear icon). Then go to the `Mods` tab. Scroll down to the `Buy Back Gold` mod settings, and configure them how you please: <br/><br/>
![Click on the HoN 'Options' button (the gear icon). Then got to the 'Mods' section. Scroll down until the 'Buy Back Gold' options at the bottom of that scrollbar. Then click the 'Apply' button after any changes.](http://i.imgur.com/Gp3Z9LD.jpg) <br/><br/>
*Note: You need to click `Apply` when you're done making changes!*

###Configuring the Movable Frame
The in-game overlay is considered a movable frame, and is configured through the HoN movable frames options.

1. The first step here is to enter a practice game (through the `Hosted Games` button in HoN).

2. Once you are in a practice game, open up the HoN menu while in-game by clicking on `Menu -> Chat`: <br/><br/>:

3. Go to the HoN `options` menu (the gear icon). Then go to the `Mods` tab. At the top of this tab, click the `Configure` button under `Movable Frames`: <br/><br/>

4. This will allow you to configure the movable frames however you want (including the `Buy Back Gold` overlay). You can simply click and drag the frame around to the position you like on screen. <br/><br/>
*Note: You can also turn it off through here (although, it is worth removing it from the `HoN Mod Manager` completely, if you wish to never use it again).* <br/><br/>
